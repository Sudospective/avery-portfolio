                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>My journey through development began when I was 14 years old, creating short programs in Lua for a game engine called LOVE, or Love2D. Since then I've been creating programs, games, apps, and plugins for various platforms, and I have installed, set up, hosted, and maintained several websites in my past 8 years of software development, including using databases such as SQLite and MySQL, CMS services like Wordpress and Ghost, and query-based web languages like jQuery, PHP, and Handlebars.</p>
                    <p>One of my favorite activities is group coding. Whether it's side-by-side on location, or day-by-day remotely, having others to work with is a great pleasure and even a great review. I've worked with several other seasoned programmers on projects such as video games, software addons, and program optimizations.</p>
                    <p>Surprisingly, coding isn't my only passion. I also enjoy creating music, editing videos, broadcasting games, and watching late-night Netflix with my roommate. Some of them I end up doing on the same project! The creative world of art never ceases to captivate my attention and wonder.</p>
