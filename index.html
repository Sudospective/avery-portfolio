                    <p>
                    I'm a software engineer currently located in Kansas City, Missouri. For me, development is more art than science.

                    Here's some of the things I've been up to:

                        <li>A <a href="https://www.github.com/Sudospective/syndibox">text engine</a> asset for the growing-in-fame game engine Godot</li>
                        <li>A <a href="https://sudospective.net">stylish website</a> where all of my accomplishments live</li>
                        <li>A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1186960/Cowboys_vs_Hipsters">real-time strategy</a> game you can actually play on Steam</li>

                    <p>
                    I can get pretty busy, but I'm always available for a <a href="#contact">quick chat</a> if you need me.

                    <h2>About Avery</h2>
                    <p>My journey into technology began when I got my first computer for myself. It was an old HP Pavilion laptop that I got from my grandmother on my 12th birthday. It was nice to finally have my own Windows XP laptop, but there were many, many problems with it. I remember that to keep it from freezing, I had to take a clamp and squeeze one side of it just to make sure it would still miraculously function like normal. At that point, when that laptop finally died, and I was given another hand-me-down, I finally told my father that I wanted a desktop for my next machine. We built one, and I was so happy, but quickly saw the lackluster performance of the thing playing games with my friends. I went to my dad, who knew plenty about computers, and asked him what we could do to make it faster. That was when I looked at the insides of a computer for the first time. It sparked something in me. Having this dusty rig lying down on the pool table in the garage, my dad replacing parts and carefully applying thermal paste, I suddenly felt like I was doing something important. I felt like an assistant surgeon with an artificial life under the knife in desperate need of saving. Since then, I've spend 10 years by the side of the great Google-sensei to open my mind to the world of tech and software and networking. I was so entranced at the complexity of something that makes daily life so simple, that I couldn't help but learn not just how to fix machines, but how to build them, make programs for them, make them talk to others, all this crazy stuff that I could never fully teach to my mother.

                    <br>
                    I don't just deal with development, either. Many of my hobbies include music, video, gaming, streaming, drawing, and lots of other creative passions. I have an entire <a href="https://www.soundcloud.com/pekoneko">Soundcloud</a> discography available to the public, and I've been working to revive my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/sudospective">YouTube</a> channel to provide content mainly centralized around games and thoughts and processes that go into making them. All in all, I make sure to keep myself busy with creative projects. My greatest desire is making a performing stage for every art medium out there.</p>
