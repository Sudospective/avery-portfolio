                    <h1>Hi, I'm Avery!</h1>
                    <p>I'm a software engineer in Kansas City, Missouri.

                        For me, development is more art than science. Here's some of the things I've been up to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A <a href="https://www.github.com/Sudospective/syndibox">text engine</a> asset for the growing-in-fame game engine Godot</li>
                            <li>A <a href="https://sudospective.net">stylish webpage</a> where all of my accomplishments live</li>
                            <li>A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1186960/Cowboys_vs_Hipsters">real-time strategy</a> game you can actually play on Steam</li>
                        </ul>

                        I can get pretty busy, but I'm always available for a <a href="#contact">quick chat</a> if you need me.
